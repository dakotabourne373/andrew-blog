Google finally released it is prototype chat AI named BARD. Unlike OepnAi, which uses the GPT language model, BARD was trained on a "lightweight and optimized version of LaMDA." This presents some concerns, but not for how powerful the AI might be but instead the opposite. LaMDA is known to have minimal cognitive response generation, which could lead to a less powerful AI; yet, it is also to note that Google's CEO asked staff to internally fact-check the AI to ensure it only gives correct results. ^[ https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-chatbot-googlers-sundar-pichai-2023-2 ] That idea alone shows a small quantity of inefficient training data the LaMDA model had, which significantly hurt its true cognitive processing ability and shows the lack of Google's ability to train LaMDA properly on correct datasets. However, Seeing the battle between BARD and Chat GPT and how it plays out in the coming years will be interesting. ^[ https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/ ]
