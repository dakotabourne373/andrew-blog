Intel's Co-Founder Gordon Moore died at the age of 94 on March 24th. Moore started his career going into Physics and then quickly switched and worked for Shockley Semiconductor. He left with the "traitorous eight" during a merger and proceeded to help Co-Found Intel. Moore has shaped computer mechanics at its fundamental level, developing Moore's Law and seeing the microprocessor's power. Moore and his wife, Betty, also established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which has donated over \$5.1 billion to charitable causes since 2000. Moore's contributions to Intel and the technology industry as a whole have had a lasting impact on the world, and he will be remembered as a pioneering scientist and entrepreneur. ^[ https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/gordon-moore-obituary.html ]
