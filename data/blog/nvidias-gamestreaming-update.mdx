This is a significant update pushed to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service, which remains the top player in the industry when it comes to cloud gaming. This update will allow 4K RTX at 120fps cloud gaming in the select cities of San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Frankfurt, with further rollout to more areas expected in the future, all for 19.99\$ USD a month. Competitors like Microsoft’s cloud gaming can only do a max of 1080p at 60fps with the ability for localized upscaling to 4k; however, it is to note that Microsoft does not have RTX capability in their cloud gaming service. Seeing this expansion into higher-end processing for cloud gaming could decrease high-end computer buying in these areas because not everyone can purchase a 5,000\$ machine on top of existing bills, so this could be seen as a money-saving option if Nvidia can get the price down. Perhaps we could see a tiered system allowing you to pay less for a lower resolution, but only time can tell.^[ https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/01/19/geforce-now-thursday-jan-19 ]
