This is the most significant push from the open-source community and a private entity seen in a while. JEDEC partnering with the Open Compute Project Foundation will open the door to future open sources of chipset projects allowing the market to become more competitive and not directly subjected to the three significant standards (AMD, ATI, Intel.) Of course, introducing it will likely not produce a substantial shift in the chipset landscape. Still, it can offer new avenues for hobbyists, all while allowing startups to use an open-source chipset. This could also be a stunt by JEDEC, so they don’t have to deal with a future Antitrust lawsuit with being the largest Association that designates chipsets and policies guiding them. Despite the possibilities of “what” it could be, it is still a good starting point to see open-source projects officially implemented and organized by one of the most significant chipset associations.^[ https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230124005158/en/Open-Compute-Project-Foundation-and-JEDEC-Announce-a-New-Collaboration ]
