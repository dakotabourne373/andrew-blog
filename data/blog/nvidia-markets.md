Nvidia might start doing dirty supplier tactics to help sell its high-end stock. This news comes from a known leaker, "mooreslawisdead" who has a history of getting things right and, of course, very wrong in the past. However, this time the claims don't seem farfetched and are in line with standard business practices. Nvidia has dumped massive amounts of money into the 4000 Series GPU and, very precisely, the production of the 4090 products only to have sales be below expected, and the sales decline happening faster than expected. This is due to the strong 3000 series and the better price-performance ratio of the 4080, which presents Nvidia with an option to limit the stock of the 4080 to get people to buy the top-of-the-line 4090 exclusively. Of course, this success will entirely rely on the consumer's want to pay how much 4090 costs, which could be considered a bad investment. If this leak is accurate, it could put Nvidia in hot water with its target market.^[ https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lousy-RTX-4080-sales-allegedly-prompting-Nvidia-to-constrict-RTX-4090-stock-to-push-people-towards-the-US-1-200-offering.696049.0.html ]
