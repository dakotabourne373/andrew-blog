Intel quickly after publishing Q4 loses of 2022 pushes a money grab attempt. This “money grab” is Intel selling numerous financial notes with an extremely large principal value that it might not be able to payback. One might ask “well what is a note?”, in the simplest terms it someone giving you money for a piece of paper that states “You will give me x amount and I will pay you back (x\* x%) + x in x years.” In total all the notes being sold has a principal cash value of 11 billion USD, with an average return rate of 5.3286% over an average 16.428 years. Despite the large risk Intel is taking this might be an extremely smart financial move with the returns in the future being much lower than the expected value of inflation allowing them to “make more money” to then pay the notes. However, it is to note Intel takes massive risk in posting the short-term monetary notes that are set out 2 and 5 years, and could potentially put the company in financial trouble when Intel is due to pay them back. Overall, only time will tell Intel’s future and financial stability. ^[ https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-corp-prices-11-billion-investment-grade-notes.html#gs.pwdz1b ]
