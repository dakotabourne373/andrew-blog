Intel has just published its earnings report for the last quarter of 2022, showing a continual decline. This constant downward trend in Revenue has pushed intel to lay off anywhere from 500-1000 employees, with no official number being reported anywhere. Of course, this is a minor hit to such a large company and nowhere near the reduction that Google did, reducing its workforce by a total of 6%, followed by a multi-billion investment into AI development using neural nets. Hopefully, this layoff trend will end in the coming quarters, but without any big releases from intel and the domination of AMDâ€™s new CPU, we might see further layoffs coming from intel, but only time can tell.^[ https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2cead9b6413a1a91de449423742eea20/intel/db/887/8894/earnings_release/Q4+22_EarningsRelease.pdf ]
