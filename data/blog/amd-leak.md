This benchmark leak comes days before the official release of the CPU on February 27th. The benchmark shows an apparent processing decrease of 10% in multi-Thread benchmarks over the normal 7950x; however, that doesn’t mean it’s a “bad CPU.” This is because the expanded V-Cache is known to hurt single and multi-thread processing speeds, in turn, for more incredible video processing speeds. The balance of bottlenecks in a computer constantly fluctuating between CPU and GPU allows the CPU to process the frames faster, giving the user a higher fps average. Despite the decrease in the same model, it is still faster overall than Intel’s top-of-the-line I9-13900K, which is slower on almost every metric. This card is made explicitly for speedier processing of graphical applications and will be used in such a way by professionals or avid computer hobbyists/gamers. ^[ https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-benchmarks-leak-10-percent-slower-versus-7950x/ ]
