Nvidia’s A100 GPU’s are finally making their way onto Gen5 Motherboards which support ultra-high capacity PCI lanes. These server’s have been provided by Supermicro and have been shown to allow the GPU’s to do accelerated computing for STAC benchmark while being in the 99th percentile of latency, which is far beyond any competitor and any previous GPU to market. They also see this low latency throughout other test and other A variant models, which if true and it can be replicated outside of Nvidia’s housing it can be a significant driving factor for enterprise applications to upgrade, and especially time sensitive applications like the financial sector. Of course, this GPU will not be making it into the hands of consumers anytime soon due to the average price point of 10,000$ USD and its specific use for calculations and not graphical rendering. This specialized use case for these GPU’s means even if it does make it into a consumer system, they won’t be any use mostly because they don’t have a single output port. ^[ https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/02/stac-ml-inference-gpu/ ]
