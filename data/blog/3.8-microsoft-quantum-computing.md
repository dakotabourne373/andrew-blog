Microsoft implements hybrid computing creating a more stable quantum environment. However, this combination requires massive amounts of classical computing power to control a quantum machine and handle error correction algorithms to maintain stability. The Integrated Hybrid feature allows developers to use classical and quantum code together, opening up new quantum algorithms, prototypes, etc. Microsoft believes that the massive power of cloud computing will enable it to deliver the required classical computational power needed to control these machines, which will be critical to the future of quantum computing. Until actual advancements in quantum computing, we will need these classical computational methods to verify the quantum computers' qubits. ^[ https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2023/03/08/microsoft-is-harnessing-the-power-of-the-cloud-to-make-the-promise-of-quantum-at-scale-a-reality/ ]
