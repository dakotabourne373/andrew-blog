With numerous partnerships AMD powers the world’s most powerful supercomputer which is promptly named “Frontier.” ^[ https://www.techradar.com/news/exascale-is-here-amd-powered-frontier-supercomputer-obliterates-world-record ] This supercomputer is the most power efficient super computer per processing power and can process the most raw data than any previous computer that has ever existed, with its power intake being 21MW and its speed ranging from 1.102 exaFLOPS from 1.685 exaFLOPS (Rpeak). ^[ https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/frontier_specsheet.pdf ] This is also the first super computer in the world to pass 1exaFLOP which is equal to one quintillion floating-point operations per second. Unlike most previous super computers this one is not specifically designed for military use and instead designed with science in mind allowing scientist to come to Oak Ridge to use the speeds to solve some of the most challenging and commutive heavy questions and problems. ^[ https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/press-release/2022/05/hewlett-packard-enterprise-ushers-in-new-era-with-worlds-first-and-fastest-exascale-supercomputer-frontier-for-the-us-department-of-energys-oak-ridge-national-laboratory.html ] Fronters first main goal will be simulating fusion, nuclear fission, and other energy production methods, and this is done for science and because this was heavily funded by the department of energy. Despite where the funding has come from, it is amazing to see a super computer being put to use in a positive developmental way, instead of what they’ve previously mostly been used for, which is for mysterious purposes by the department of defense.
