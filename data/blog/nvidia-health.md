VinBrain is a software / AI based algorithm that can detect numerous problems with someone, however recently it just got expanded. VinBrain was just approved by the FDA to start diagnosing collapsed lungs in humans. This after AI finally became “smart” enough to give correct results after being trained on more than 2.5 million images. The VinBrain team used NVidia enterprise GPUs to train the AI over multiple computation heavy evolutions to finally perfect the algorithm to indicate if someone has collapsed lungs. Do note, this is not the first AI driven program has been used and approved to help medical professionals diagnose and or prescribe medication to a patient based off symptoms, pictures, etc. This is a large leap for the medical sector allowing better diagnoses of problems in the field, which in turn helps patients get the treatment they need allowing them to have a speedy recovery. Hopefully the VinBrain team and or other organizations further invest into medical AI analysis to create a medical system that can help prevent life altering sickness for people. ^[ https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/07/vietnam-vinbrain-deploys-healthcare-ai/ ]
