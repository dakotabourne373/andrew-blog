Ryzen has fully released spec sheets around its most powerful consumer CPU, 7950X3D. It is part of AMD’s new 9th Gen architecture using an LGA socket type and outperforming all of Intel’s and prior AMD consumer chips. This could potentially see a further market shift towards AMD after years of Intel’s dominance in the consumer space. It could lead to more development in its brand name to expand further into industrial / enterprise computer systems. AMD also is making bold claims saying it is “52% faster in productivity apps” than Intel’s flagship I9-13900k, which if true could be a significant blow to Intel’s chip dominance allowing rapid expansion of AMD in the consumer market.^[ https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-ryzen-7000-3d-v-cache-ces-2023/ ]
