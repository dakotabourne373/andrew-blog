The world's largest semiconductor manufacturing company is starting to plan its 2nd major expansion, and for a good reason. TSMC produces the top-of-the-line semiconductor producing the smallest NM chips ever produced for massive international companies daily, making TMSC one of the most valuable tech companies on the planet. The problem with TSMC is its location, Taiwan, which presents an ever-growing threat to major global companies. Due to China's territorial claim over Taiwan, there has been constant aggression from the Chinese military, and we could see a potential invasion of Taiwan in our lifetime. This aggression has forced TSMC to expand and break ground in the US and potentially look into building additional production plants in Japan to keep up with demand and have a failsafe if an invasion of Taiwan ever occurs. To meet the company's goals, they have pledged a 7.4 billion USD investment into manufacturing additional chip lines in Japan (12 and 16nm Chips). Overall, this is an excellent thing for the industry, Japan, and the company. ^[ https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822892 ]
