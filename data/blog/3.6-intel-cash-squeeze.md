Intel is putting pressure on the EU and Germany for more money. This confusing scenario started after Intel’s planned 33\$ Billion Euro research center in Germany was announced after the EU’s Chip Act poured 43\$ Billion euros into European semiconductor production. Intel’s initial estimate back in 2020 was that the project would require 17 billion Euros to complete, but due to inflation, rising costs, and lack of funding through the Chip Act, it will now cost Intel over 30\$ Billion. The decreased estimated funding from the Chip Act has caused Intel to halt construction until it is further subitized, allowing the company to incur reasonable costs. After all, in Intel’s eyes, Germany should view this as an investment into their own country just as much as Intel should view it as an investment into its company. ^[ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-07/intel-wants-5-billion-more-subsidies-from-germany-for-new-chip-plant ]
