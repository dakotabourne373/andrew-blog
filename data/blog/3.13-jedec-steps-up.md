JEDEC has officially started a Subcommittee for the Automotive industry. This is big news for the auto industry and could impact consumers with more standardization of car safety features and requirements. This committee is tasked with numerous things, including ensuring standards can be applied across different devices, modules, temperatures, firmware, and quality and creating test and verification procedures. This can help create a more unified automotive industry giving the consumer more bargaining power when choosing a particular car brand over another. However, it is to note that any of the work JEDEC is currently doing it will not become applicable for at least another 1-5 years, and the consumers will notice a difference when it comes into existence in the next 5-10 years. Still, this is a significant step for the reparability of new automobiles and sustainability regarding the physical hardware device and firmware of these new electronic component-based cars. ^[ https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-creates-new-automotive-steering-subcommittee ]
