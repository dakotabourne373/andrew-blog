This is a gigantic implementation for Microsoft, and it goes beyond Bing. Microsoft is working on implanting ChatGPT into its inbuilt search function which utilizes Bing, and this can give anyone with a computer the power of generative and responsive AI unlike anything else on the internet. The main rival to ChatGPT is Google’s unleased BARD AI which is based off the lest impressive LAMDA algorithm, and which has shown marginal generative features and capabilities. With ChatGPT being built into windows 11 computers via Bing network it could improve the user base of Bing and further Microsoft’s dominance in the tech space outside of their OS platform. ^[ https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-is-bringing-chatgpt-powered-bing-to-windows-11-in-latest-update-140039652.html ]
