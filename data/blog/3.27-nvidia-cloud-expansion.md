At the Game Developer Convention (GDC) Nvidia announced new tools to help developers bring their games to the GeForce Now Cloud almost effortlessly. Developers can use the GeForce NOW Developer Platform to integrate their games, interact with the cloud gaming service, and test their creations. The SDK allows games to query for cloud execution, launchers to trigger cloud streaming and facilitates account linking and game library ownership syncing. On top of the SDK development to help developers, Meta will use Nvidia for Metaverse cloud rendering, furthering Nvidia’s place in the market as the largest GPU manufacturer. The Cloud gaming role has expanded in Europe and is now in Sofia, Bulgaria. Finally, Nvidia plans to support the new Cyberpunk full raytracing update in the cloud gaming environment. ^[ https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/23/geforce-now-thursday-march-23/ ]
