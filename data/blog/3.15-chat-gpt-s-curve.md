Microsoft is expected to release the newest version of ChatGPT in the coming weeks and this could be ground breaking for the Internet. The new version of the AI will be able to be intermodal allowing it to accept audio and visualize inputs and be able to understand and analyze them. Such an idea is not groundbreaking and has been done before, but with GPTâ€™s language model it could present a massive step forward for visual and audio processing and or generation depending on how far openAI implements and branches its features. This drastic rate of innovation also presents a unique scenario where AI could surpass the S-Innovation Curve and become a dominant presence in everyday life and application in a short period of time. ^[ https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/chatgpt-4-everything-we-know-so-far/ ]
