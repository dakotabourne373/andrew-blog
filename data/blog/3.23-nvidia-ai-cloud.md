With a somewhat unsurprising turn in the AI world, Nvidia is making a big push to offer cloud AI processing to customers. Since companies are making a big push to implement AI into their system, it was reasonable for Nvidia to push and offer such a service allowing them to fill this niche appropriately. The downside to Nvidia’s cloud AI is that it only uses Nvidia’s in-house ai models for images, video, language models, and 3D rendering. If Nvidia falls behind in developing its in-house AI models, it could lose market share quickly, especially in such a new and quickly growing industry. AI will continue to grow, and Nvidia entering the market for it is just another company throwing its towel into the ring, and only time will tell who wins. ^[ https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-generative-ai-to-worlds-enterprises-with-cloud-services-for-creating-large-language-and-visual-models ]
