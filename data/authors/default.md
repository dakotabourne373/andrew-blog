I have a significant background in the tech sector has a consumer and have always enjoyed reading articles and blogs about the newest hardware and tech, so I thought Iâ€™d give it a shot! I have a large amount of experience in building, maintaining, and modding consoles / computer systems. I can understand most core building blocks of software and hardware and their implication fairly easily on a system and for the general society. Overall, the landscape of technology is constantly changing so its good to know about the changes have also have an understanding on how that might affect the company and the existing tech world for the users.
